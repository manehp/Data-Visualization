*Part 5: Overall performance*
Define unique color for each team per season. For each season create horizontal bar plot using total
 number of points. Highlighting the winner with the unique color that you assigned to it. Save all
 graphs in pdf.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

```{r}
df2 <- read.csv("/Users/Administrator/bundesliga2.csv")
```

```{r}
team_colors <- rep(brewer.pal(12, "Set3"), length.out = length(unique(df2$TEAM)))
team_color_map <- setNames(team_colors, unique(df2$TEAM))
```

```{r}
pdf("HW4_Part5_R_Bundesliga_Season_Performance.pdf", onefile = TRUE)

seasons <- unique(df2$SEASON)

for (season in seasons) {
  
  season_data <- df2 %>% filter(SEASON == season)
  winner <- season_data %>% filter(POSITION == 1) %>% select(TEAM) %>% unlist()
  
  ggplot(season_data, aes(x = reorder(TEAM, -POINTS), y = POINTS, fill = TEAM)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = team_color_map) +
    geom_bar(data = subset(season_data, TEAM == winner), 
             aes(x = reorder(TEAM, -POINTS), y = POINTS, fill = TEAM), 
             stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c(team_color_map, winner = "gold")) + 
    coord_flip() +
    labs(title = paste("Bundesliga Season Performance: ", season),
         x = "Team",
         y = "Total Points") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
